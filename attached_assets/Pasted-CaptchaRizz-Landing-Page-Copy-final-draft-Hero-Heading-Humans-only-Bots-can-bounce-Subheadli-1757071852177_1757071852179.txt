How it works

Enter the gate – You hit a page and need to prove you’re real.

Pass the vibe check – Answer a quick human-only prompt (slang, meme logic, or tiny expression task).

You’re in – Welcome, human. Bots get blocked.

Features

AI-Powered Filters – Knows what bots can’t fake.

Custom Vibe Checks – Choose memes, slang, emoji math, or micro-gestures.

Zero-Friction UX – One tap, sub-2s median time, accessibility-safe mode.

Plugs in Anywhere – Drop-in widget for websites, apps, and games (REST + JS SDK).

Why CaptchaRizz?

Because traffic-light CAPTCHAs are so 2005.

Bots don’t know Gen Z slang. That’s the firewall.

Smarter than CAPTCHA, funnier than 2FA.

Privacy-first. No biometric storage; on-device checks where possible.

Social proof / Meme wall

“First time I wanted to take a CAPTCHA.” — @realuserlol
“Failed the first rizz check… humbling.” — @techbro
